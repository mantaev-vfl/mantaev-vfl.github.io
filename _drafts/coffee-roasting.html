<p>Coffee, for some, is not an option but more of a necessity. Its what they purchase first in the morning, have alongside when working, and choose to have during social gatherings. These are the people that are considered “coffee addicted” and the reasons behind such desire is what most people are oblivious to (including myself).</p>
<p>A thought came across to me one day as I was taking a stroll through the densely populated city of Toronto - to observe the amount of people holding a cup of coffee or are within a cafe. To my surprise, it was a lot. A lot to the point that even attempting to avoid seeing such beverage would be deemed as an impossible task. The whole city has clearly immersed themselves in a new trend; the reasoning behind sparked my curiosity.</p>
<p>In search for answers, I purchased a book the following day; <i>Pour Your Heart Into It</i> by Howard Schultz. Not only does this book reveal the fundamentals of running a successful enterprise but depicts the passionate dream that unraveled from the CEO of Starbucks himself - to recreate the same authentic feeling he experienced in the coffee bars of Milan and infuse it into North Americans. Without a doubt, he had accomplished this (maybe more than he expected). The proof was evident on the day of my jaunt in Toronto and fortunately this book was able to settle down my anxiety.</p>
<p>With Schultz having to ponder about the same question, he came up with the following three conclusions:</p>

<b>A taste of romance</b>: People that visit stores such as Starbucks have only a five to ten minute break away from the routine of their daily lives. Where else can these people get the exotic taste and smell of coffee beans from countries such as Brazil, Italy, Kenya, or Costa Rica? Having such a chance lightens people's unremarkable days.
<br>
<br>
<b>An affordable luxury</b>: No matter the working class of two people, for example, a policeman and a doctor; one may not be able to afford the same expensive Mercedes that the other drove up in but both can purchase the same $2.00 coffee. 
<br>
<br>
<b>An oasis</b>: Even though fewer than 10 percent of people in Starbucks actually have a conversation with another person (most silently wait in line and speak only when ordering), the presence of being at a Starbucks store is what they consider to be a safe place away from the familiar faces they see everyday. Many find Starbucks a "third place" outside of work and home.
